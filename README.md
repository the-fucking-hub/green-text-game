# green-game

## An Idea (wip)

You must be 3 players minimum.
Each players chooses 3  randomed words in a list.
Must create a sentence with this 3 choosed words.

The finished sentences of earch players are put together in a generated green Text

## disclaimer

I start this project to be confident in term of web dev and reuse some techs and practices I encounted during my jobs.

My main difficulties is to synthetise and choose a path and make simple, I apologize in advance.

Feel free to contribute, I configured git to help you.
( prefer rebase instead of merge)

The architecture will be improve.
(
    for example I will put pinia as a plugin ^^,
)

## tech I want to use/ try

- web components
- cube css with every layout ( I want to run away from boostrap)
- sockets (no sockets io )
- more of vite (globals etc...)
- go ( I Do AYDENHEX ! )
- more svg/canvas api


## basic idear of the UI

### styles guidelines

vercel (because it's cool)

### UX (wip)

first page : landing

As player I want to set a playerName because I don't want to put my real name and I want to be reconisable among my friends.

second page : Lobby (epic)

As player I want to see all the player before playing because I want to verify if all the invited player are ready to play before lauching the game.
