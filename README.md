## disclaimer

I start this project to be confident in term of web dev and reuse some techs and practices I encounted during my jobs.

My main difficulties is to synthetise and choose a path and make simple, I apologize in advance.

Feel free to contribute, I configured git to help you.
( prefer rebase instead of merge)

The architecture will be improve.
(
    for example I will put pinia as a plugin ^^,
)
